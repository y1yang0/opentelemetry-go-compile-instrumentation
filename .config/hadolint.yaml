# Rules to ignore
ignored:
  # DL3018: Pin versions in apk add.
  # Pinning apk package versions is impractical as they change between Alpine releases.
  # We pin the Alpine base image version instead for reproducibility.
  - DL3018
  # DL3059: Multiple consecutive RUN instructions.
  # We intentionally separate RUN commands for different build phases to optimize
  # Docker layer caching and improve readability.
