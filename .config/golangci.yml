## Golden config for golangci-lint v2.1.6
#
# This is the best config for golangci-lint based on my experience and opinion.
# It is very strict, but not extremely strict.
# Feel free to adapt it to suit your needs.
# If this config helps you, please consider keeping a link to this file (see the next comment).

# Based on https://gist.github.com/maratori/47a4d00457a92aa426dbd48a18776322
# Added our customizations to the config.
