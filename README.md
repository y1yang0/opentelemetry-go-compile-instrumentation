# OpenTelemetry-Go-Compile-Instrumentation



OpenTelemetry-Go-Compile-Instrumentation provides compile time  [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) instrumentation for [Golang](https://golang.org/).

## Getting Started

Run `sh -x build.sh` to show instrumentation example. In this example, we will inject a piece of code into the `main` function of the `main` package under the `demo` module to output the "Entering hook" string. This injected code comes from the `sdk` module.
If you want to check the result of instrumentation, go to the directory location that appears as output when running build.sh, e.g., WORK=/var/folders/x9/fddsvlt5363c0plvvw8_2mr80000gn/T/go-build2020695287.

### Navigate to the WORK directory:
```bash
cd /var/folders/x9/fddsvlt5363c0plvvw8_2mr80000gn/T/go-build2020695287

### Locate the main package under the b001 subdirectory:
```bash
ls -l b001

### Inspect files:
cat modified.go
