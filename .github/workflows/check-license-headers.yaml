  # This is a required workflow, so it must always run and report a status.
  # We use dorny/paths-filter at the job level instead of workflow-level path filters
  # to ensure the workflow runs and the "done" job reports success even when no relevant files change.
  # This prevents PRs from being blocked by missing status checks.
